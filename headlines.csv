"Well I've been deep in thought over the last few years and lately have been feeling very down and depressed started looking in the mirror and not like what I'm seeing. I am a sis woman but believe that I might be a trans man. I've been genderfluid the last few years bounced back and forth between masc and fem views of myself. Lately have been hating my breasts. I've always had large boobs even growing up as a kid and it was all anyone ever saw when the looked at me. I feel fake and hate them. I've done everything to follow along the path of my assigned gender at birth but every day seems to be getting harder. I've been trying to get a reduction (I have size JJ breasts) but more and more the thought of full top surgery has been appealing. The thought of being able to walk outside with out a shirt on makes me giddy but I know I can't. My breast have been the bane of my existence for forever. I'm used to the attention I get from them but I want someone to see me and not just my chest. I've also been doing alot of reading on phalloplasty also said it wouldn't be a thing I did but sex as a woman is becoming difficult. Penitration has never gotten me off and porn is all POV from the man's POV and can only get off if in my head I have a penis and fucking someone. Can only get off witha vibrator... it's becoming more and more frustrating and I want to come out but I'm scared and what if it's just all in my head? But also the ball is already rolling and I know I can't stop it but also do I even want to? I've been struggling with thoughts of wanting to just start over. Be done with this life and try again. I'm not happy in my own skin and hate mirrors. 😒 idk this post is mainly to get somethings off my chest and get some feed back from others to see if I am actually experiencing gender dysphoria or if I just hate my boobs lol TIA for any advice

"I figured out I was genderfluid around a year ago. 

Things were more subtle when I was a little kid: there would be times where I would strictly not want to wear nail polish, would strongly desire to be treated as ""one of the boys"" with my guy classmates, and overall turn away from feminine behavior or anything I thought made others perceive me as ""girly"". ""I'm a tomboy/girl-girl today"" was the best my language could describe it as. I also remember many instances of insisting on wrapping my bath towel around my waist like I knew men to do, and feeling melancholy about having to cover my new chests once puberty came. There were more examples, but I want to try and keep this concise for you all.

Starting when I was 16, at random cycles of time, feminine clothing or presentation would make me uncomfortable, and boxier clothing that hid my shape made me feel better. Three years later, I got long braid extensions at my mother's suggestion, and I ended up having what seemed like a full on breakdown after seeing myself  in the mirror. Once I quicky left the hair shop, I wept for an hour straight once I got in the car because of what I saw. ""I look like some girl!"" is what I immediately thought which really confused me because I thought I was a cis woman up until that point, especially with my great love for feminine things (I know now that femininity is seperate from gender. Sometimes, I do enjoy feminine presentation when I'm not a girl in a way that just feels like a fun costume which complicates things further for me)

So I figured I was some flavor of non-binary and wear a shorter, more androgynous hairstyle and still do my occasional switch the neutral or men's clothing. But all of a sudden yesterday, I became hyper aware of my chest and hips as I walked. I grew more and more uncomfortable, but this time was determined to ignore the feeling. Not much long after, I quickly ran to my room to change into my baggiest shorts and shirt. But somehow that wasn't enough this time. I started to cry as I a panicked and looked for something better that I knew I didn't have as I only own baggy women's shorts instead of men's. When I looked at myself in the mirror my breathing became increasingly erratic and I started sobbing uncontrollably. I was forced to explain everything to my parents because I was wailing so loudly. It took me 2 hours or so to fully calm down and during that time I thought I was going to pass out or go crazy - I didn't know what was going to happen because it had never been that intense before. 

What in the world is going on with me? Does dysphoria intensify with age or something? What do I do because it feels like nothing I wear could make this feeling stop this time, I feel like I just want out of my body which I can't do because I'm pretty sure I'll go back to being a woman eventually. If anyone can provide some answers, I would really appreciate the help.

"I'm having one of those bad days. Sometimes I doubt I am event truly trans or just going by a stupid phase, even though I've felt like this pretty much since I remember. 

The worst part of it all is that when I am in one of those ""low dysphoria"" phases, I *want* to go back to the bad phase, I *want* to feel super gender dysphoric again just because feeling dysphoria makes me less scared I'm committing a huge mistake... and it kind of makes me feel ""part of the community"" I guess, as if I wasn't already ""trans enough"".

"So ill start off with im 28 been married for 5 years and my wife knows nothing about the ""darkside"" of me so it started about 3 years ago the wife and i were joking around and talked about her pegging me and then one day it happened.....best orgasm ive ever had! (Not the point) since then i have craved to be ""pretty"" when she's not home i put her panties on, yoga pants, lingerie, etc. etc. I want to wear skirts and high heels and do stuff a masculine military male shouldnt do lol but i also wanna smash random girls or guys dont really care lol but i do love my wife and i love sex with her but i just feel lost lately with so much death in the world i just wish to be reincarnated as a sexy blonde! Idk i just needed to vent it all sounds great in my head but as i type it out i feel so dumb anyway its out there now....

"I know this is a weird question, so I’m trying to make sure I ask it the right way….especially because this is something I have been thinking about posting for a long time. Is it possible to be ‘trans’ when the part of your identity that feels trans corresponds to your body? 

Currently, to my knowledge, I am a cisgender woman, but something about the experience of that femininity, even if it feels gender affirming, feels like it’s not necessarily ‘me’ - like it’s something that I enjoy, but don’t consider part of the whole story, or ‘it’, when it comes to my gender…could I be a feminine trans man? 

I know, it seems counterintuitive to (on occasion) like the feminine appeal of the way my chest and hips look in a dress, but simultaneously like the self-determined ‘masculine’ appeal of having broad shoulders and still feeling ‘masculine’ in some way. Idk, it feels like someone who feels like they’re actually a man wouldn’t simultaneously seek out gender affirmation through things that are traditionally feminine or parts they already have that are often found in other cis women, which is why I wonder if I’m overthinking it. Idk. 

Edit: I’ve also felt euphoric accidentally being called ‘son’ by people, but I don’t know if I would want to be called he/him.
Just kind of confused about it all.

"I am likely to gain custody (not guardianship) of a 12-year-old, Gender Dysphoric trans-male in the relatively near future. He is socially transitioning, but is not likely to get hormones until 18. 

I have been studying A LOT to find some ways to help him with his Gender Dysphoria, and I believe I have some ideas. The problem is that studies seem to take for granted that the only help for Gender Dysphoria is to transition.

So, I'm asking for advice from anyone who either had to wait several years before hormones or anyone who did transition, but still felt Gender Dysphoria afterward. Are there any therapies, medication, or mindsets that helped you be less Dysphoric or (if applicable) at least less depressed?

"Hello! I’m looking for people to submit ideas for the sub icon as I feel it currently doesn’t really do a good job at representing the sub. I’ve tried to come up with some ideas but haven’t got very far. Any ideas are appreciated, and all I’m looking for, at most, is a sketch of your idea.

Things I’m looking for:
- Represents the experience of both FtM and MtF people, this sub is welcoming of non-binary people but it’s too challenging to try to include them in the icon as being nb can present different ways in different people. 
- Icon must be at least 800px by 800px

"I’m 23 and I haven’t ever addressed my gender dysphoria explicitly, I try to ignore it. But today I’m going to a family wedding and I’m wearing a dress, earring and have my hair done nice. I’ve not dressed like this since my year 11 prom when I was 15. 

I’m not feeling great and I feel incredibly uncomfortable:(

"So to start off I want to say we are not professionals but my friend does have Gender Dysphoria and they related what I said to Dysphoria and they recommended this sub

We Established 3 things

1. The Though Of My Own Name Makes Me Uncomfortable 

2. I've Struggled With My Identity In General As Early As 4 Years Of Age

3. I've Never Felt Comfortable With Myself Or In My Own Skin

On a possibly related note At Birth I was supposed to be a Girl but I changed after the fact (currently M14 btw) Maybe its that part of my psyche slowly resurfacing or maybe its some estrogen left behind messing with me (keep in mind I have no idea how Fetal Formations work so this is just a shot in the dark)

I looked it up which probably isnt the best idea but from what I saw and skimmed through this is a possible Sign of DDD (Depersonalization Disorder) or from my friends experiences its GD 

I have never though about this to much and I always thought it was normal but now I'm beginning to reconsider 

Thoughts?

"I’ve been feeling gender Dysphoria for many years. im (17/F) and I’ve always hated looking in mirror at my self I don’t take photos of me or let other people take photos of me. I hate my breasts, I hate wired bras as I can always feel them and it just doesn’t feel right. So everyday I normally wear a sports bra, but I try to in the afternoons not wear any bra but then I can always feel my breast moving about and I notice them in my vision which makes me really uncomfortable. And I don’t like really anything about me, my body just looked wrong to me. But I’ve been very secretive about it as im a major over thinker and terrible at looking at the bright side of things.

I was thinking of coming out to my parents some time in lockdown but my older brother came out as trans and I felt like I couldn’t come out as it would seem like I was copying him or trying to get attention. ( I don’t know in all honesty it just didn’t feel right) so I pushed it down. I was able to make my self in to kind of like an empty canvas in my mind so when ever I looked in mirror I just saw my clothes or my hair not me standing there. So I was able to sort of live with it pushed down.

But today I was with my two close friends who are both Trans and we ended you talking about Gender Dysphoria. I think I got to comfortable with them and I ended up spilling like every thing about how I wish to maybe transition and now I’m not sure what to do. I’ve brought all of those feelings up to the surface again and I was going to tell my mom ( as I though maybe I should just tell her) but before even that we ended up speaking about it we had a large scale argument ( I don’t have the best relationship with her but my dad left this year).

I don’t now what to do , my depression has spiked up in just these hours and I keep thinking that if I do maybe at least I my next life I can be born as a lovely boy instead of being stuck in a body that makes me cry.
---------------------------------------------------"
"So I (afab) have been experiencing gender dysphoria I’m pretty sure. I absolutely hate having a female body and I’d do anything to have a male one; I’d even do surgery. I don’t like going by she/her pronouns and I feel uncomfortable when people address me as a girl. I also hate my long hair, so I went to the salon today and cut most of it off. And I just want to be a boy. That’s all. Like I really want to be one. But I dress very femininely, like pink and skirts and all that typical stuff. 
I’m confused 😭anyone have advice or something?
---------------------------------------------------"
"I wish I had a nice, big, veiny dick, so that I could shove it down throats, so that I could be satisfied when I came, so it could have nuts underneath (instead of a damn pussy hole, that bleeds every month and stinks sometimes...)

If I didn't have my pussy, I might miss it a little; but I like it almost as much in the ass anyway, and I heard that people with prostates still have a G-spot back there that's about the size of a walnut.

I also hope someday to get top surgery, because these ugly chest blobs do absolutely nothing for me at all...

If I wasn't terrified of doctors, and if I knew better how to ""navigate the systems"" and was better equipped with community resources, then I might have a slightly better body, even if it is a bit shorter than most men...

(For that matter, I honestly wish I was 6'4"" tall, which is a foot and an inch taller than I actually am...)

"Starting last year, I suddenly felt gender dysphoria for the first time. I was scared and confused. 

Ever since, sometimes at least once a month on my period, I feel gender dysphoria. I hate it because me being on my period isn’t what causes gender dysphoria in relation to having a period - I honestly think it’s my hormones. I actually looked this up and it’s a thing for cis women to experience gender dysphoria while on their periods but being fine the rest of the month. 

Which is why I fucking hate this. I DONT WANT TO BE A MAN. That’s not who I truly am. Yes I like dressing masculine sometimes, I like being gay af, and I do think of living as a man sometimes. But everytime I go through gender dysphoria I don’t think “yes I want to be a man and want to live as a man” I think “I may want to be a man now, but it’s not who I truly am.” I consider myself gender fluid, and I try to accept that I can be both a man AND a woman, but I’m sick of having fleeing thoughts of being a man.

I’m fine with my body and boobs/ass. But the bodily discomfort I still feel and I hate it. I don’t want to feel like this. I don’t want to be a man deep inside, even if I do for a week straight each month. I’m tired. Just please get rid of this.

"I (15M) stopped cutting my hair about a year and half ago as I really didn't like my new one that I had and couldn't decide on a new one, since then, I didn't like it, but I didn't hate it, it was more than barrable.
But for the last few days, it grew to have a natural parting, and I looked at myself in the mirror and, I hated my hair, really, really hated.

I feel like I look at a woman instead of a man, and no matter how much I know that hair has nothing to do with gender, I just can't get over how I was raised.

I really really don't know what to do, I really need your help. Thanks.

"Hey people! I just wanted to share that I've had full blown gender dysphoria for 11 years (maybe even longer) It's constant pain and suffering, but I'm hanging in there. Its a bit difficult to go through my life when I have female shaped landmines in my head, but I've gotten pretty good at hiding my gender-related panic attacks. Anyways If yall are out there reading this with similar issues and modern medicine doesn't have the answers you seek, you're not alone in this unending nightmare.

"I’ve had GD for as long as I can remember and it comes and goes. It’s gotten pretty bad right now. When it acts up, my normal clothes don’t feel right anymore and women’s clothes feel more comfortable. My sexuality seems to change and I find myself more interested in men. I want to look attractive but I feel despair when I look at myself in the mirror because I don’t think I’ll ever look the way I want. I want this to go away so I can feel ok with how I am.
---------------------------------------------------"
"For a few years now, I really wished I was I girl. I would constantly see girls wearing really cute outfits and always wish that I could pull it off like they could. Girl clothes have always been extremely alluring to me, and I tend to be a relatively feminine dude in general. I’m on the shorter side, I’ve got a thin hour glass ish body shape, my hands and feet are pretty small, I grew my hair out long, pierced my ears and wear some pretty girly earrings. Basically anything I could do to appear more feminine without wearing female clothes. I’ve always taken pride in my feminine traits and it’s probably the part of myself that I’m most proud of. I finally took the next step this year and actually wore a skirt to prom “as a joke.” Someone brought it up in passing to me as a joke and I said ya I’d totally do that, but tbh I think I was just looking for any reason to go all out and try really hard to appear the way I wish I was. I was definitely out of place since I looked more like a California valley girl and wasn’t wearing a dress, but if you didn’t know me or look to hard I made an extremely convincing girl and that made me feel wonder. I’ve also been misgendered a number of times over the years and I’ve always been amused by it, but more recently I’m starting to take more pride in it and will sometimes go out of my way to be misgendered because it makes me feel good. When I think about being a girl it just feels… right. Like maybe it’s some missing piece that I just have found yet. The idea of getting surgery and being able to pull off all the looks I’ve been envying for years sounds amazing and makes me feel an amount of excitement that I haven’t for a while. Like maybe I’d be happier after years of going through pretty bad depression.

The kicker about all this tho, is that I don’t feel like a girl. I don’t feel like I was “born in the wrong body.” I don’t hate that I’m a boy I’m relatively fine with it, even tho granted I really wish I wasn’t. I most certainly don’t have an issue with my male sex organs or masturbating. All of that feels perfectly natural and good. I would be lying tho if I said I didn’t wish for female sex organs and to get off that way rather then male organs. I know the idea of needing to be trans because you “were born in the wrong body” is kinda on its way out these days and you don’t need to feel that way to be trans, but I’m not entirely convinced. I want so badly to change my gender/sex but I’m just not sure any of what I’m feeling actually counts beyond “he just wishes he had tits.”

If anyone has any thoughts or insight and wants to share, I would definitely be grateful.

"TW: dysphoria

Can someone please tell me it's gonna be ok. I am 3 months and half on T. I'm tired of being so dysphoric. I'm sick of being misgendered. I feel like all I can do is wait for my body to change but waiting is killing me. 

I'm tired of hyper masculinizing in an attempt to get gendered correctly. I'm still not passing and I don't feel like myself dressing that way.

I'm scared of intimacy because I hate my body. It feels lonely as fuck. 

I'm glad my body is changing, I'm greatful to be on T. I did the paperwork to legally change my name and gender. I'm starting to save money for top surgery. I started to workout more consistently. I'm doing stuff to get better, to look more like myself. But why is it so long?

Today is a bad day. I can't get out of bed and feeling miserable. I wish I wasn't trans. I wish I could just go back to living as a girl and being okay with this. Why is it so hard? I'm scared of going out today because if I hear another ""she/her"", I'm gonna loose it.

Words of affirmation and advice welcome 💜
