# Gender-Dysphoria-Reddit-Scraper-Classifier

The aim of this program is to consider reddit posts from r/genderdysphoria and determine whether they fit under the guidelines and criterion set under the new specification of DSM-5. This will be achieved through using PRAW to scrape post data through reddit’s internal API. Then, by using stemming and lemmatization techniques to be reduced texts to only essential and tone-defining words, to make comparisons to stored keywords which match the DSM-5’s criterion.
